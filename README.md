Tips for making it even better:
Add a Real Screenshot: Replace the "placeholder" links in the Screenshots table with actual images from your images/ folder.

Include a "How to Contribute" section: If you want others to help improve the template.

Would you like me to help you write a "Features" section for a specific part of the code, like the responsive grid system?
